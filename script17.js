//const arr1 = ['Apple', 'banana', 'orange' ]

//const arr2 = ['Lion','Tiger','leopard']

//arr1.push('Mango') to push mango in arr1 list or for adding the new item in array 

//arr1.pop for removing the item from back side or remove last item as you give arr1.pop()

//Array methods in js

 
//const evenNumbers = [0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16]

//evenNumbers.shift() = to remove starting numbers or items, changing the index of items in the arrays

//evenNumbers.unshift(-2);
//.unshift add any new items in starting of arrys items

//console.log(evenNumbers.unshift(-2));

//const oddNumbers = [1,3,5,7,9,11]


//to add to arrays we use concat property the syntex is here

//but condition is that the length of both arrays are same or equal
//let arr1  = ['a','b','c','d','e','f','g','h']

//let arr2 =  [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

//Proper syntex to add two arrays

//let concatenatedArray = arr1.concat(arr2);

//console.log(concatenatedArray.join(' ,')); //output : [a,b,c,d,e,f,h,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

// indexOf() gives the place of item in arrays

//arr2.indexOf(5);

//console.log(arr2.indexOf(5)); // output is 4

//includes()  
// this property shows the  boolean value in return if present than true if not present than false





//arr2.includes(9);

//console.log(arr2.includes(9));

// reverse() reverse the whole array

//arr1.reverse();

//console.log(arr1.reverse());

//Sort() = it sort or place all the items off arrays in alphabtical order
// or arrange them in a perfect order wheather it is number or alphabet arragged in diorder 

//arr1 = ['c', 'r', 'a','b']
//arr2 = [3,4,8,2,1,0,12]
//arr1.sort();
//console.log(arr1.sort());


//slice() = slice means it when we put any item from array into the .slice() then it cuts from that item and give all items as a result which come after from that particular item  which is firstly put into slice()

let arr1 = ['rat','camel','lion','tiger']
let arr2 = ['kite','logic','superman','thor']


//arr2.slice(2);
//console.log(arr2.slice(2));


//splice() = it is used to delete the item from array by giving its index number

arr1.splice('rat','DOG','CAT','hEllo','hello','exvb');
